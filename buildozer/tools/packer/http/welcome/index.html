<h1>Welcome to the Kivy/Buildozer VM</h1>
<p id="menu">

</p>

<p>
    Thanks for using Kivy/Buildozer VM. It has been installed only for
    packaging Kivy application for Android.<br/>
    <b>Credentials</b>: username: <code>kivy</code> / password: <code>kivy</code>
</p>

<h2>How to use the VM</h2>
<p>
    Buildozer has been used to build a project and should be functionnal
    for yours. It is preferrable to add a Shared Folder and build from there.
    By the time we shipped the VM and you using it, you may need to
    <a href="#update-buildozer">update buildozer</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Go into your project directory, then:
    <pre># Just build your application
buildozer android_new debug

# Build your application, deploy on the phone,
# run it, and display the logs from the phone
buildozer android_new debug deploy run logcat</pre>
</p>
<p class="warning">
    Virtualbox doesn't support symlink in Shared Folder anymore. So buildozer
    will fail during the build.<br/>
    We already created a <code>/build</code> directory where you can put your
    build in it. Edit your <code>buildozer.ini</code>:
    <pre>[buildozer]
build_dir = /build/buildozer-myapp</pre>
</p>

<h2>Update buildozer</h2>
<p>
    The buildozer version you have may be outdated, as well as the dependencies.
    The best is to regulary update buildozer:
    <pre>sudo pip install -U buildozer</pre>
</p>

<h2>Cleaning cache</h2>

<p>
    The simplest way to update kivy and other modules is to clean all the
    buildozer cache, and rebuild everything.

    <pre>rm -rf ~/.buildozer/android/packages</pre>
<p>
